# Summary

At some stage in my career, it became obvious that the amount of data being generated in science surpasses what one would be used to not too long ago. I have always found algorithms and programming languages interesting, and the marrying of informatics and science is one of my favourite things. This gives me the opportunity to be involved in diverse projects. \

"PhyloPi", "An affordable, purpose-built phylogenetic pipeline for the HIV drug resistance testing facility", "HIV drug resistance testing involves sequencing some parts of the viral genome, which informs us of the virus's susceptibility to Anti-Retroviral drugs.  If the patient shows resistance to a particular drug they are taking, this guides the clinician in adjusting the regimen.  Additionally, when generating this sequence data one can do phylogenetic analysis as quality control.  This led us to develop a standalone bioinformatic pipeline. Apart from the academic adventure this also gave us the opportunity to write about HIV on RStudio's blog post (https://rviews.rstudio.com/2019/04/30/analysing-hiv-pandemic-part-1/).  This four-part series shows the analysis of public data using R and was a fun outreach and I am quite proud about the people I got to work with.",


"Sequencing, ecology and surveillance", "Data generation and analysis. Sequencing, bash, python", "The ability to generate sequencing data and the analysis of this data allows me opportunities to collaborate in projects such as viral surveillance, the interesting viruses and microbes occurring in infant guts, fungi in urban water and all kinds of other sequencing projects.",

"Hepatitis B infections", "Python, data wrangling, infographics, statistics, R", "In the crazy world of data, we are analyzing patient laboratory test results about Hepatitis B infections and in part trying to show how this very infectious but preventable virus is neglected.  Previously we also worked with some friendly people from Oxford where we did a meta-analysis on the serology of hepatitis B in Africa, and we made an interactive dashboard of this (https://hbv-geo.shinyapps.io/oxafricahbv/).",


"A microgrid in an energy crisis", "Influxdb, telegraf, grafana", "Working with the brilliant people at the GRRG (Grid Related Research Group) and the eResearch High Performance Computing unit, we developed a dashboard showing real-time power consumption and grid frequency (https://s.ern.ufs.ac.za/grrg) for both the Bloemfontein as well as QwaQwa campuses. We are using data to manage resource planning for power demand and, together with the ICDF (Interdisciplinary Centre for Digital Futures), are trying to understand how social layers and the usage and understanding of electricity influence each other."
